                        <p class="text-sm opacity-70 mt-4">Pro Tip: I always provide a mix of color and black & white edits to give clients options for different uses.</p>
                        
                        <p class="mb-4">The post-production phase is where technical precision meets artistic vision. While many photographers rush through editing to meet tight deadlines, I've learned that this is where the true narrative of an event takes shape. Through careful color grading and tonal adjustments, we can transport viewers back to how the moment actually felt - not just how it looked.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4">After years of refining my workflow, I've discovered that sequencing images is just as crucial as editing them. The order in which photos appear in a gallery creates an emotional arc that mirrors the event's natural progression. This attention to storytelling transforms a collection of beautiful images into a cohesive narrative that resonates deeply with clients.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4">The decision between color and monochrome isn't just an aesthetic choice - it's a powerful tool for emotional emphasis. I've found that black and white conversions can strip away distracting elements and draw viewers directly to the raw emotion of a moment, while thoughtfully preserved color can capture the exact ambiance of a carefully designed event space. This dual approach ensures we preserve both the emotional truth and the visual accuracy of each moment.</p>
